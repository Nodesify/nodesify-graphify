# graphify skill (Aider)

When the user types `/graphify`, run the nodesify-graphify knowledge graph pipeline.

## Step 1 - Build or update the graph

Run in terminal:
```bash
node -e "const fs=require('fs');if(!fs.existsSync('.graphify/graph.json')){console.log('missing')}else{const age=Math.round((Date.now()-fs.statSync('.graphify/graph.json').mtimeMs)/60000);console.log(age>30?'stale':'fresh')}"
```

- `missing` → run `nodesify-graphify run .`
- `stale` → run `nodesify-graphify update .`
- `fresh` → skip to Step 2

## Step 2 - Read the report

Read `.graphify/graph_report.md` and summarize: hub nodes, communities, surprising connections.

## Usage with Aider

Aider focuses on code editing. Use graphify to understand the codebase before making changes:

```bash
nodesify-graphify query "authentication flow"    # understand a feature
nodesify-graphify explain "UserService"           # see what a class does
nodesify-graphify path "Config" "Database"        # trace dependencies
nodesify-graphify affected "UserService"          # blast radius of a change
```

After editing, run `nodesify-graphify update .` to keep the graph current.
